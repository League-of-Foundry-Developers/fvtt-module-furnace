# The Furnace

The Furnace is an essential part of every Foundry.

This Foundry VTT module brought Quality of Life Improvements to the VTT.  
It started by adding Drawing Tools functionality to FVTT and then an experimental Macro system. It has evolved into many small QoL Improvement features, some of which were later integrated into the core Foundry software.  

Currently, this module does not have any functionality and serves besides pointing users to its successors.
